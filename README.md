# example-just-react

A minimal example of a Reflame React app.

Reflame is completely self-contained, and not dependent on Node, NPM, or any other tools.

All that's needed to get started is a [config file](https://github.com/reflame/example-just-react/blob/main/.reflame.config.jsonc) and an [app folder](https://github.com/reflame/example-just-react/tree/main/app) with your code.

Use the [Reflame VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=reflame.agent) to develop locally against Live Previews. Use development mode for instant, state-preserving updates with React Fast Refresh, or production mode for full production-parity, and switch between the two at any time.
