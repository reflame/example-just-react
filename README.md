# example-just-react

A minimal example of a React app built using Reflame app.

Reflame is completely self-contained, and not dependent on Node, NPM, or any other tools.

All that's needed to get started is a config file and an app folder with your source code.

Use the [Reflame VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=reflame.agent) to develop locally against Live Previews. Use development mode for instant, state-preserving updates with React Fast Refresh, or production mode for full production-parity.
